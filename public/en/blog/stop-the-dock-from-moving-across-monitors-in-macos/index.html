<p>Does your Dock keep leaping from one monitor to another in your macOS multi-display setup? Tired of chasing it around like a cat after a laser pointer? Here are some real-world (and slightly tongue-in-cheek) ways to keep your Dock where it belongs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money solves everything!&rdquo; Buy <a href="https://docklockpro.com/">DockLock</a> and force your Dock to stay put on one screen. (Your wallet gets lighter, but your mind gets calmer.)</p>

<h2 id="2-corner-the-dock-">2. Corner the Dock ↔️</h2>
<p>When the Dock is at the bottom, it gets extra jumpy. Move it to the left or right and its urge to wander drops dramatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want it done right, do it yourself!&rdquo; Use Hammerspoon to keep an eye on your Dock and shout &ldquo;No escaping!&rdquo; (Some coding skills and patience required.)</p>

<h2 id="4-make-the-dock-disappear-">4. Make the Dock Disappear 🫥</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t stop it from jumping, I&rsquo;ll just make it vanish!&rdquo; Set the Dock to auto-hide and crank up the delay so high, it&rsquo;s basically a legend.</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Auto-hide the Dock</span>

<p>Maybe the Dock&rsquo;s wanderlust is just its destiny. &ldquo;Go where you want, Dock&hellip;&rdquo; Find your inner peace and let it be.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>May your Dock be ever stable! (And may Apple someday fix this for real&hellip;)</strong></p>
